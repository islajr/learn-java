# Build Tools - Gradle
A build tool is a CLI program that automates the process of compiling, assembling and deploying software.
However, they are not limited to these features.

Some build tools can help with package management, dependencies, unit-testing and CI/CD.

Build tools find their use case in large projects where it is complicated to keep track of or to manually execute the build process.
In these situations, build tools are employed to make the process more consistent and less confusing to manage.

## Gradle
Gradle is an open-source build automation tool that is capable of building almost any type of software.
It provides support for building, testing and deploying software on different platforms.

Gradle works by describing everything on the basis of **projects** and **tasks**.

A **project** may be anything from a web application to a JAR Library. Each project is made up of one or more tasks.

A **task** is a single piece of work that a build performs. It is a subdivision of a project. For example, it could be **compiling classes**, **generating a javadoc**, etc.
