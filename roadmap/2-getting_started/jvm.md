# How JVM Works
JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine, and it's purpose is to execute programs.

It is a platform-dependent specification that provides a runtime environment in which java byte code can be executed.
The JVM runs on the host's operating system and places its demands for resources from the system.

Since the JVM is a 'specification', it can have various implementations, as long as they adhere to the specifications.
