# Spring, Spring Boot and everything in-between.

Spring and Spring Boot tend to be two confusing frameworks to beginners, but it is actually really easy to pick apart.

**Spring** is a java-based framework that allows developers to build robust applications in java.
**Spring Boot**, on the other hand, is a framework used for creating stand-alone pre-configured spring-based applications.
They are both used to develop web-based applications in java.

For years, spring was the only means of building web-based applications in java, and it fulfilled that role very well, but with the growing demands of the field, spring grew too, and it eventually became too difficult to set up and deal with.

Creating and setting up new projects became a bother, as was the testing and security process.

Spring Boot was created to solve these problems. Being built on top of spring, it natively extends all of spring's attributes.
It is also lighter and focuses on convention over configuration and as such, is easier to work with.

## Spring Boot and Backend Development

Spring Boot works for backend development in the same way other backend frameworks work, but with a bit more complexity as it is being written in java which is known for being verbose and complex.

### Controller

This is the most important part of the application. It helps map URLs and generally dictate and implement methods that need to be implemented when the URL is accessed.

### DAO

This part of the application dictates how data is stored. It receives information and feeds it to the **service** which ultimately feeds it to the controller.
